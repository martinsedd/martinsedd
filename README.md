### Hi there, I'm Eduardo Martins 👋

> "One step ahead and you are not in the same place anymore." - Chico Science

I'm a Software Engineering student with a passion for backend systems, developer tooling, and distilling real-life structure into clean, efficient code.

### About Me

For over a decade, I honed my skills in high-pressure environments as a professional Chef, mastering the arts of precision, creativity, and disciplined execution. Today, I'm channeling that same energy and dedication into a new craft: software engineering.

My goal is to build robust and scalable systems that streamline processes and make people's lives easier, one line of code at a time. I am currently a student in the Software Engineering program at **Centennial College**, eagerly applying my unique problem-solving perspective to the world of technology.

**I am actively seeking co-op, internship, or junior developer opportunities where I can contribute, learn, and grow.**
